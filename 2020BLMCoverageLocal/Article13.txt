Vandalism, looting, virus close this steakhouse

Partly due to the coronavirus pandemic and partly due to recent looting, Eddie Merlot's restaurant in downtown Louisville is closing for good.
Employees said the staff was notified on Monday that the restaurant would not reopen to in-person dining.
The high-end steakhouse at 455 South Fourth St. temporarily closed due to the coronavirus pandemic in March. Restaurants were allowed to reopen at 33% capacity under Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear's "Healthy at Work" initiative on May 22, but Eddie Merlot's, like numerous other restaurants in the area, chose not to reopen.
After the restaurant was damaged and looted May 29 and May 30 in the first days of the protests over the Louisville Metro Police killing of Breonna Taylor, an unarmed black woman who was shot inside her home while police served a no-knock warrant, owners decided to close the restaurant permanently.
Eddie Merlot's website and various social media channels still list the Louisville location as temporarily closed. The steakhouse's closure also means the Starks Building on Fourth Street is now empty. Eddie Merlot's was the last tenant at street level.
