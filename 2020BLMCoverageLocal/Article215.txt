A Breonna Taylor billboard in Louisville's Irish Hill neighborhood has been vandalized with red paint.
Drivers who were used to seeing the image of Taylor on the billboard on Lexington Road near Spring Street, one of 26 put up around the city with the police shooting victim's face on it, instead saw her image smeared with red paint splattered across her forehead Tuesday.
The 26 billboards were put up by officials with O, The Oprah Magazine, which recently used the same image on a magazine cover.
The billboards call for the three Louisville Metro Police officers who fired their weapons the night Taylor was killed to be arrested and charged for their involvement in the case, which left the 26-year-old Black woman dead in her apartment and led to protests in Louisville and around the nation.
It also directs readers to visit the website for Until Freedom, a social justice organization that moved to Louisville last month to work with protesters and call on city and state officials to take action.
