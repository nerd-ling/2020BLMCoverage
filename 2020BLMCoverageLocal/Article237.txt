Michelle Obama at DNC: Taylor was murdered
Austin, Emma
19 Aug 2020
In her Monday speech closing out the first night of the Democratic National Convention, former first lady Michelle Obama named Breonna Taylor as another on the long list of people of color who "continue to be murdered."
"And here at home, as George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and a never-ending list of innocent people of color continue to be murdered, stating the simple fact that a Black life matters is still met with derision from the nation's highest office," Obama said in her headlining speech at the 2020 DNC.
"Because whenever we look to this White House for some leadership or consolation or any semblance of steadiness, what we get instead is chaos, division and a total and utter lack of empathy."
The death of Taylor, a Black woman who was unarmed when shot and killed by Louisville police in her home in March, has sparked months of protests in the city.
In response to Obama's statement that Taylor was murdered, spokeswoman Elizabeth Kuhn said the attorney general "remains committed to our office's thorough and independent investigation into the death of Ms. Taylor."
Obama has previously spoken out about Taylor's death, including in the second episode of her new podcast and on Instagram.
