A group of roughly 30 people attempted to set the Hall of Justice on fire Sunday night, according to Louisville Metro Police.
The incident occurred at the south side of the Hall of Justice's main entrance shortly before midnight, according to Louisville Metro Police Department spokesman Lamont Washington, who added that a Molotov cocktail was thrown at the building. He declined to provide additional information on how many were thrown.
Washington said a majority of the people in Jefferson Square Park fled before officers arrived.
According to Washington, Jefferson County Sheriff's deputies came to address the fire, and several water bottles were thrown at them from a crowd. Then, a group set fire to a pile of trash in the middle of Sixth Street.
The Louisville Fire Department put out the fire shortly thereafter, and Metro Public Works cleared debris from the street, Washington said.
Police did not arrest anybody, he said.
Louisville's FBI Office is leading the investigation, Washington said. FBI spokesman Tim Beam said the Louisville office "is currently working with the Louisville Metro Arson Bureau to identify those responsible for these criminal acts."
"FBI Louisville firmly supports everyone's ability to exercise their constitutionally protected First Amendment rights; however, throwing Molotov cocktails or attempting to set fire to the Hall of Justice is not peacefully protesting and is a violation of state and federal law," Beam said in an email.
The affiliation of the group involved in Sunday night's incident is unclear.
Amid protests for Breonna Taylor, several buildings in downtown Louisville, including the Hall of Justice, have been boarded up.
