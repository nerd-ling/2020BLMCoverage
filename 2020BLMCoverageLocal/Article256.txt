Ex-U of L star Brown to wear decal in honor of late Taylor
Robinson, Cameron Teague 
Former Louisville offensive lineman and Louisville native, Jamon Brown, is taking another step to honor Breonna Taylor. He plans to wear her name on his helmet this NFL season.
As protests in Louisville have now exceed 60 days to fight for justice for Taylor, the 26-year-old Black woman who was fatally shot by Louisville Metro Police in her apartment on March 13, Brown wanted to continue to help the movement from Atlanta.
A week ago, the NFL decided to allow players to have decals on the back of their helmets to honor victims of police brutality or systemic racism. Taylor's death hit Brown, and offensive lineman for the Atlanta Falcons, especially hard he told The Courier Journal in early July.
"First off I was thinking about what if that was my sister. I would want answers," Brown said of his reaction to Taylor's death.
Since then, Brown has been a fixture in Louisville this offseason either protesting with the community or helping it through the COVID-19 pandemic.
He's been to countless protests with his first one being in the first week. He's led Louisville football players to clean up the morning after protests and passed out Kroger gift cards in partnership with Louisville Scoop to help families in need.
He's not shy about using his platform to bring attention to Taylor's case.
Though Brown will be reporting to training camp with the Falcons soon, he said he and his foundation, the Jamon Brown Foundation, plan to keep doing work in Louisville. And bringing attention to Taylor's death in any fashion.
