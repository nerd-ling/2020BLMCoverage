Livestreamers to view at protests
Loosemore, Bailey
06 Sep 2020
Protests on behalf of Breonna Taylor — an unarmed Black woman who was shot and killed by Louisville police — have continued for more than 90 days.
During that time, livestreams have broadcast events as they've unfolded, capturing pivotal moments and transporting the city's demonstrations anywhere someone has a device with internet access.
The people behind the streams are both media veterans and self-described protesters who spend dozens of hours each week covering demonstrations, interviewing city officials and showing both the joy and anger that takes place every day.
And as the protests continue, the livestreamers say they've only become more committed to documenting the movement.
