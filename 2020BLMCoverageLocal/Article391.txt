Kentucky Alliance hopeful on Gentry

Those involved with the Kentucky Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression are cautiously optimistic when it comes to new Louisville Metro Police Department interim Chief Yvette Gentry, according to board member K.A. Owens. But six months after the death of Breonna Taylor, he says Gentry has her work cut out for her.
"We hope Chief Gentry is able to get a grip on LMPD and prove to the community that it is under some kind of control," Owens said. "This is important for all our sakes."
Owens was among those who spoke Sunday at the Carl Braden Memorial Center, where those involved with the ongoing protests addressed recent developments.
A former deputy chief who left the department in 2014 and went on to serve in Mayor Greg Fischer's administration and as a project director for Metro United Way, Gentry will take over as head of LMPD on Oct. 1, when current interim Chief Robert Schroeder retires.
Gentry understands what's happening in the city and is "well qualified," Owens said, and her place as the second Black person and first woman to lead LMPD is significant. But he stressed that fellow board members "hope she has not only been hired to bear the burden of possible unrest as a result of whatever decision the attorney general of Kentucky, Daniel Cameron, makes in regard to the Breonna Taylor case."
Cameron's office will decide whether to charge the three officers who fired their weapons the night Taylor was killed. A decision could come as soon as this week.
