Mother speaks up at Cameron's office

Tamika Palmer, standing beneath the awning of Attorney General Daniel Cameron's Louisville office, stopped speaking multiple times to brush aside tears.
"Breonna (Taylor) should definitely be here," she said Friday of her daughter, a 26-year-old Black woman who was fatally shot by police in March. Breonna Taylor, she said, always brought people together.
But, "at this point, it's so much bigger than Breonna," she went on. "It's so not over. I would give you every dime back for my baby."
The latter referred to the $12 million civil settlement the city made with Taylor's family this week.
Palmer, joined by about 100 protesters at Cameron's office on Whittington Parkway, made it clear the civil settlement doesn't pacify her desire to see the officers involved in Taylor's death arrested and charged.
"Daniel, just do your job," she said. "It's just that simple. It was six months ago. If we would have did it to one of them, where would we be?" she asked.
Palmer was joined by Pastor Timothy Findley of Louisville's Justice and Freedom Coalition, local activist and poet Hannah Drake, Shameka Parrish-Wright with The Bail Project and Linda Sarsour with Until Freedom, among others.
"I am a Black mother," Parish-Wright said. "We came to stand with another Black mother. ... We have to continue to be here for each other, continue to show up, continue to strive for real justice, real equality, because we should not be dying at the hands of people that we pay."
Protests over Taylor's death started May 28. A decision in the case could come as soon as next week: the downtown federal courthouse will be closed next week in anticipation of an announcement.
