LMPD halts days off as city awaits decision on Taylor

The Louisville Metro Police Department has canceled all days off and pending vacation requests while waiting for Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron's decision regarding the Breonna Taylor case.
The state of emergency cancellations are "until further notice," LMPD said in a Monday statement. According to an internal memo, the order is to "ensure we have the appropriate level of staffing to provide for public safety services and our policing functions."
Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was fatally shot by Louisville police in March.
Since late May, protests, demonstrations and marches have filled Louisville. Among the calls for reform is the demand that the officers involved in her death be arrested and criminally charged.
Those officers are Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, Detective Myles Cosgrove and ex-Detective Brett Hankison, who was fired in a decision he is contesting.
A decision in the case could come as soon as this week. The downtown federal courthouse will be closed in anticipation of an announcement.
"The public may also see barriers being staged around downtown, which is another part of our preparations," LMPD spokesman Lamont Washington said. "It is important to note that the AG has said there is no timetable for the announcement."
Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday evening that he could not comment on his discussions with Cameron about a decision timeline.
