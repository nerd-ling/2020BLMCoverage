Beshear: Protesters should get tested for coronavirus

Gov. Andy Beshear on Thursday urged the hundreds of protesters who have gathered in the streets of Kentucky cities during the past week to get tested for the coronavirus.
Since May 28, protesters have taken to the streets in Louisville to protest the death of Breonna Taylor, the unarmed ER tech who was shot and killed in her apartment by Louisville police in March. Since then, protests sprouted in other commonwealth cities, including Lexington and Murray.
Beshear said anyone in large groups should seek out a coronavirus test.
Dr. Sarah Moyer, Louisville's public health strategist, previously urged protesters to get tested.
"Our city has gone through some very painful events over the past months," she said. "But the Department of Public Health and Wellness continues to work to achieve health equity for all of our people and to bring about a healthier Louisville where everyone and every community thrives."
All hospitals in Louisville offer testing to their patients. Call your doctor to get a testing referral.
