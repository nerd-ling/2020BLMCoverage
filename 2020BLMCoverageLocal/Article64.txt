Three people were arrested on felony criminal mischief charges early Friday morning after police say they were caught spray-painting the King Louis XVI statue in downtown Louisville.
An arrest citation says the three people, all Louisville residents, were identified by a Jefferson County Sheriff's officer as being the people responsible for vandalizing the statue around 5 a.m. Friday.
A witness recorded cellphone video that police say backed up the sheriff's officer's account, according to the arrest citation.
The three arrested are Nahtaeya Cronford, 19; Antonio Harris, 20; and Jordan Novak, 20.
The 9-ton marble statue of the once-king of France, who helped colonists win the Revolutionary War before his public beheading during the French Revolution, was constructed in 1829, commissioned by the king's daughter, Maria-Therese.
It has stood at the northeast corner of West Jefferson and South Sixth streets since 1967, a gift from Louisville's sister city in southern France, Montpellier.
The statue's right hand was broken off two weeks ago during protests over the police killing of Breonna Taylor.
