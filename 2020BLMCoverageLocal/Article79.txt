Crowds dispersed, but we stayed. What one Courier Journal photographer saw during protests
Clevenger, Michael
31 May 2020
The protest began like many that I've seen before.
Chants of "No Peace, No Justice" and "Say Her Name" in reference to the shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by Louisville Metro Police in mid-March while sleeping in her apartment, filled the air. Most protesters had their phones up, scanning back and forth to show the size of the growing crowd in downtown Louisville. While it "felt" the same at first, the fact that a large Megabus parked on the north side of the intersection of 6th and Jefferson streets was blocking traffic was immediately different.
The protest was peaceful at that location, with organizers strongly urging protesters to lock arms and stay in line. I heard a woman with a bullhorn trying to keep order. A short time after it began, around 8:30 p.m., a large group broke away and headed down Jefferson Street and then to the Clark Memorial Bridge at Second Street.
I continued to take photos as protesters and police met face to face at the base of the bridge. Organizers urged protesters not to provoke the police, to remain calm. At one point, a small group of people locked arms to keep protesters from getting too close to a Louisville police officer who had been backed up to a Bearno's Pizza restaurant.
Things began to slowly become more agitated between police and protesters. The organizers tried to keep some sense of calm, often putting themselves in between both groups and, in the end, encouraged the group to disband. Some left, others stayed.
I stayed. The five other Courier Journal photographers also covering the protest stayed.
Police used paintball guns and pepper balls to try to disperse the crowd and tear gas hung in the air over 6th and Jefferson as protesters tried to advance on the police with a line of picnic table used as shields.
It was surreal.
Most of the photographers on the Courier Journal staff grew up in Louisville â€“ it's our home. Every single one of us hated to witness a night like Thursday, much less see these images through our camera viewfinders.
It's a day the photo staff hoped we would never experience and hope not to see again.
