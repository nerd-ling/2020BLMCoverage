Norton Healthcare and the Louisville health department are both offering free COVID-19 testing to those who have been participating in recent protests.
Hundreds of Louisville residents have gathered downtown and in other locations nightly during demonstrations and vigils marking the lives of Breonna Taylor and David McAtee, who died this spring in police shootings in Louisville.
Free drive-thru and walk-up testing will be offered at Norton's testing center from noon to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at 3101 Poplar Level Road. Residents do not need to have symptoms. They also don't need a referral from a doctor. But registration is required because tests are limited.
To register, visit bit.ly/NHCCovid19Test. And be sure to bring an ID.
The Louisville health department has approved Bluewater Diagnostic Laboratories to provide free, walk-up COVID-19 testing for protesters Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The site will be in the parking lot bordered by Sixth Street, Congress Alley and Seventh and Market streets, directly behind City Hall. No appointments are necessary.
