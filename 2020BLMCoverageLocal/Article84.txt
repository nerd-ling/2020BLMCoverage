Three people were charged in a criminal complaint Monday with looting a Louisville CVS last week.
Jean-Pierre Crowdus, 31, Frederick D. Eaves, 31, and Channel Lewis, 26, all from Louisville, worked together to loot the CVS at 3130 Portland Ave., according to U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman.
Around 1:15 a.m. June 4, police who responded to an alarm saw Lewis behind the wheel of a car outside the store and Crowdus and Eaves inside the store, according to Coleman.
Police later found a Smith & Wesson M&P .40-caliber gun next to the driver's seat of the car. Coleman said another person bought the gun in Louisville last July.
Coleman cited a video which "shows Crowdus forcing entry into the CVS with a crowbar" to allow Eaves and Crowdus inside.
Crowdus allegedly crawled through the pharmacy window after forcing it open and took items from the pharmacy and put them in a trash bag.
According to Coleman, Crowdus tried to get into the pharmacy safe with a crowbar as well while Lewis served as the lookout in the vehicle outside.
"These charges have nothing to do with legitimate protest activity and everything to do with looting a neighborhood pharmacy," Coleman said in a statement. "This lawlessness places protestors, police, and near-by families at risk, and will be met with swift federal arrest and prosecution."
The protests around Louisville have been mostly peaceful as hundreds each night have taken to the streets to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed in her apartment by Louisville police officers in March.
